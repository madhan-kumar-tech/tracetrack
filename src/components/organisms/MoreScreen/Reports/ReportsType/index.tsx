//Usage
/*
The navigation knows which screen was pressed because,
when you navigate from the main Reports screen, you pass a parameter
(e.g., configKey: 'other' or configKey: 'geofence') to the ReportTypeScreen
*/

/*

Then, in ReportTypeScreen,
 you use useRoute() to read the configKey from route.params,
and use it to select the correct config and render the appropriate report UI.
